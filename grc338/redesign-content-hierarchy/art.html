<h3>Musicians</h3>
<p>Linnaea's is one of the city's premier venues for live music, and hosts events almost every night except Mondays. Some  nights are reserved for poetry, story telling, artist receptions,  weekly jazz jams, and monthly folk music jams. Here's our calendar. Most performers,  particularly those new to Linnaea’s, play for tips, CD sales,  coffee, and dessert. Four acts per month are paid $50.00, and those slots  are booked up 3-5 months in advance. Linnaea’s has no PA system or  sound gear, so musicians bring their own, or simply play  un-amplified. There are no cover charges, and all ages are welcome.

Shows are held in the main room, which seats  about 30 with tables, or 40 chairs arranged in rows with tables removed.

All musicians are booked by the owners of the cafe, Marianne and David.  Email them here to book a show.</p>

<h3>Visual Artists</h3>
<p>Art for the café is booked almost a year in advance. Every September a  call for art is placed in the local papers and our social media. All artists are interviewed and the 12 artists for the  following year are chosen sometime in November. We generally have  anywhere from 30-60 artists apply for the 11 open spots. December is  reserved for our annual “Hang it All” show, which is geared toward  giving the gift of art for the holidays.  If you are a visual artist,  contact Marianne. We also highly suggest you  join Arts Obispo. Artist receptions are always held during San Luis Obispo’s Art after Dark on the first Friday of every month.</p>
    
    <h3>Our People</h3>
